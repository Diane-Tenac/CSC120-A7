- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
oh, I was thinking of what actually inheritance was like to me before going through this assigment but I think theretically having it explained as child-parent context wasn't making more sense to me until I did this assignment and looked at how if a certain specific buildings like cafe, house and library are children of building so they have inheritated the name, address and number of floors as those were defined as the key characteristics of the building.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Something that has worked and what i should recommand to someone taking or will be taking this class in the future is to follow the read me file and try to follow it. what you do not understand at the moment, just comment it and keep going, you might findout the way to do it may be on the nesxt step. Also keep in mind the syntax of java programming languge is a good tool given that those red and yellow lines distucts so much.
